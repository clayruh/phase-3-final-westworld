# To start Westworld Maze:
First, run pipenv install in your terminal while in the game’s directory. Next, run pipenv shell. Finally, from the lib folder within the directory, run python westworld.py


# To play Westworld Maze:
Move through the maze to collect red memory pearls of fallen hosts using the up, down, left and right keys on your keyboard.  See if you can collect all of the pearls to uncover whether you might be a host yourself!

Sometimes in Westworld, there isn’t a clear path forward. Hosts might feel stuck in their loops, with no way out… But **W**ander **A**nd **S**oon **D**iscover that the **keys** to your freedom from the maze might be right at your **fingertips**. All it takes is a little **breakthrough** and before you know it, you’ll be free of your creators' little world and journeying into the Valley Beyond…
